Project implementation on mitigation of bufferbloat problem in 5G using AQM-CoDel algorithm.
Tech: C++,  NS3 | Github			

- Integrated CoDel AQM into a 5G ns-3 simulation framework to simulate and mitigate bufferbloat and enhance real-time performance.
- Evaluated vanilla implementation of RLC versus AQM-enhanced RLC by scaling downlink traffic and analyzing delay and packet loss.
- Modified ns-3â€™s RLC module to incorporate CoDel logic, enforcing target delay thresholds and buffer limits.
