Project implementation on mitigation of bufferbloat problem in 5G using AQM-CoDel algorithm.

This repository contains a 5G ns-3 simulation framework enhanced with an Active Queue Management (AQM) algorithm (CoDel) integrated into the RLC layer. 
The modifications mitigate bufferbloat, reduce delay, and improve real-time application performance by enforcing target delay thresholds and buffer limits. 
Comparative studies between the vanilla and CoDel-enhanced configurations are included, with metrics such as delay and packet loss logged for deep analysis.
